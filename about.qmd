About this site:

I am a Professor of Zoology at the University of British Columbia. To learn more about my research, go to: <https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~irwin/irwinlab/> 

Disclaimer: I am mostly self-taught in the areas of programming and computer science, so there are definitely better sources to learn about those topics. My goal here is to convey the usefulness of Julia to other biologists.

Thanks: I have benefitted greatly from many excellent courses available from organizations such as Compute Canada, the Digital Alliance of Canada, and UBC Advanced Research Computing. I also thank the many YouTubers, bloggers, and book authors who provide excellent information about Julia and other languages. And of course I thank the inventors of Julia (you can learn more at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)>).  


This whole website was generated using Quarto, which allows embedding of runnable Julia code.
