If you would like to learn more about programming and data analysis using Julia, some of the resources I have used are listed below:

### Books

There are a lot of these, and growing. Some I've used and found very helpful:

[Julia for Data Science, by Bogumił Kamiński](https://www.manning.com/books/julia-for-data-analysis)

[Practical Julia: A Hands-On Introduction for Scientific Minds, by Lee Phillips](https://nostarch.com/practical-julia)

[Julia Data Science, by Jose Storopoli, Rik Huijzer, and Lazaro Alonso](https://juliadatascience.io) *Free!!

[Statistics with Julia, by Yoni Nazarathy and Hayden Klok](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-70901-3) *Free PDF download for UBC students through the UBC library. :)

### Youtube videos

[Doggo.jl, a series of great tutorials, though a bit odd in style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlorfxsdWDw)

[Intro to Computational Thinking Course at MIT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6T56GkMHEdSrjCCheNuEwI0)

[Julia language Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage)

[A talk about Pluto.jl, by its main developer Fons van der Plas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg3r3gG4nQo)

### Online courses

There are a growing number of these. One I've done and recommend:

[Programming with Julia, by İlker Arslan](https://www.udemy.com/course/programming-with-julia)

### Other websites

[Julia language website's list of Julia tutorials](https://julialang.org/learning/)

[Julia language documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)

[The Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/)

[The Julia Forem](https://forem.julialang.org)

[The Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org)

### Irwin lab publications using Julia for data processing / visualization

I list these here because the code for many of these is freely available and provide a source for learning about how to conduct data analysis and produce graphs in Julia:

(Data and processing scripts are available at [this Dryad archive](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8w9ghx3xr). Julia functions used in data processing and graphing are provided in the new [GenomicDiversity.jl package](https://github.com/darreni/GenomicDiversity.jl), and the complete analysis scripts with explanatory comments is at [a GitHub Pages site](https://darreni.github.io/GreenishWarblerGenomics2025/) and at a [Github repository](https://github.com/darreni/GreenishWarblerGenomics2025).)
