If you would like to learn more about programming and data analysis using Julia, some of the resources I have used are listed below:

### Books

There are a lot of these, and growing. Some I've used and found very helpful:

[Julia for Data Science, by Bogumił Kamiński](https://www.manning.com/books/julia-for-data-analysis)

[Practical Julia: A Hands-On Introduction for Scientific Minds, by Lee Phillips](https://nostarch.com/practical-julia)

[Julia Data Science, by Jose Storopoli, Rik Huijzer, and Lazaro Alonso](https://juliadatascience.io) *Free!!

[Statistics with Julia, by Yoni Nazarathy and Hayden Klok](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-70901-3) *Free PDF download for UBC students through the UBC library. :)
