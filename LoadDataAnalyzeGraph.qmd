Here we'll bring together much of our Julia knowledge to actually analyze a large dataset. 

The example here will be based on a dataset from this paper:

McCallum, Q., K. Askelson, F.F. Fogarty, L. Natola, E. Nikelski, A. Huang, and D. Irwin. 2024. Pronounced differentiation on the Z chromosome and parts of the autosomes in crowned sparrows contrasts with mitochondrial paraphyly: implications for speciation. _Journal of Evolutionary Biology_, voae004, https://doi.org/10.1093/jeb/voae004

We will load in a large dataset of genotypes throughout the genomes of Golden-crowned Sparrows and two forms of White-crowned Sparrows: _pugetensis_ and _gambelii_. We will then use my own original Julia package called GenomicDiversity.jl to analyze and graph aspects of this dataset. (On 18 November 2024 this package became listed on the General Registry, meaning that you can install it simply by entering the package mode---by typing `]`--- and then entering `add GenomicDiversity` and then `using GenomicDiversity` to actually use it.)

To work through this example, start with a new Pluto notebook. Give it a name and save it, so your work will be continuously saved. You will use a set of data files that is included with the GenomicDiversity package. These are within a folder called `Sparrow_data_McCallumetal2024` within the GenomicDiversity folder on your computer, but these can sometimes be a little difficult to find if you don't know where to look. So below we will use commands that load these data files into Julia by grabbing them directly from my GitHub repository.

### Load the `GenomicDiversity` package

[![](GenomicDiversity_logo.jpg){width=30% fig-align=center}](https://github.com/darreni/GenomicDiversity.jl)

I wrote this set of functions to facilitate the analysis of and graphing of genomic data. To load download it and make it active in your Pluto notebook, write the following in a Pluto code cell and then run the cell:

```julia
using GenomicDiversity
```

It might take a couple minutes to download and install. After it completes, try this in another code cell:

```julia
greet_GenomicDiversity()
```

If you get a nice introduction, then the GenomicDiversity package has installed properly. 😄

### Load other packages

We will need a few other packages for downloading the data files, reading data files, and storing data as data frames:

```julia
using Downloads, CSV, DelimitedFiles, DataFrames
```

### Set up the paths and names for the data files stored on GitHub

```julia
begin
	demo_gitHub_folder = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darreni/GenomicDiversity.jl/refs/heads/main/demoData/SparrowDemo_data_McCallumetal2024/"
	genotype_file = demo_gitHub_folder * "SparrowDemo_genotypes.012"
	individuals_file = demo_gitHub_folder * "SparrowDemo_genotypes.012.indv"
	position_file = demo_gitHub_folder * "SparrowDemo_genotypes.012.pos"
	metadata_file = demo_gitHub_folder * "SparrowDemo.Fst_groups.txt"
end
```

These input files were produced by an analysis pipeline that took genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) reads, 
mapped them to a reference genome, identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), called genotypes of individuals,
and outputted the information in three files: 
* a genotype file containing a matrix of genotypes (rows representing individuals and columns representing loci), where 0 represents homozygous reference, 1 represents heterozygous, 2 represents homozygous alternate, and -1 represents missing data
* a `.indv` file containing individual identifiers (corresponding to rows of the genotype matrix)
* a `.pos` file providing the locations of loci in the genome (with rows representing loci, column 1 indicating the scaffold, and column 2 indicating the position along that scaffold)


### _Enough setup, let's load data!_

First import metadata about the samples:

```julia
metadata = DataFrame(CSV.File(Downloads.download(metadata_file)))
```

Above, the `CSV.file()` function interprets the correct delimitation format of the data file, and the `DataFrame()` function creates a `DataFrame` object (a wonderful way to store data where columns are variables and rows are individuals). 

Now, import the list of individuals (row names) of the genotype matrix:

```julia
ind = DataFrame(CSV.File(Downloads.download(individuals_file); header=["ind"], types=[String]))
```

Get the number of individuals:

```julia
indNum = size(ind, 1)
```

Check that the metadata file and .indv file have same number of individuals:

```julia
if nrow(metadata) != indNum
    println("WARNING: number of rows in metadata file different than number of individuals in .indv file")
else println("Good news: number of rows in metadata file matches the number of individuals in .indv file")
end
```

Combine individual names and metadata into one data structure (enabling confirmation that names match and are in correct order):

```julia
ind_with_metadata = hcat(ind, metadata)
```

Load SNP positions:

```julia
pos_whole_genome = DataFrame(CSV.File(Downloads.download(position_file); header=["chrom", "position"], types=[String, Int]))
```

Load the genotype matrix:

```julia
begin # read in genotype data 
	@time geno = readdlm(Downloads.download(genotype_file), '\t', Int16, '\n')
	loci_count = size(geno, 2) - 1   # because the first column is not a SNP (just a count from zero)
	print(string("Read in genotypic data at ", loci_count," loci for ", indNum, " individuals. \n"))
  	genosOnly = geno[:, Not(1)] #remove first column, which was just a row index
end
```

In the data matrix, rows represent individuals and columns represent SNPs, and genotypes are as follows:

0: homozygous reference; 
1: heterozygous; 
2: homozygous alternate; 
-1: missing genotype

#### [If you want to filter individuals or SNPs with too much missing data, I have scripts that can be added here]

#### Choose our groups to plot, and their colours

```julia
groups_to_plot = ["GCSP","PSWS","GWCS"]
```

```julia
group_colors = ["gold","red","blue"]
```

#### To do a PCA, we first need to impute missing genotypes

Prepare data matrix to be ready for imputation, by replacing `-1` with `missing` data type:

```julia
begin
	genosOnly_with_missing = Matrix{Union{Missing, Int16}}(genosOnly)
	genosOnly_with_missing[genosOnly_with_missing .== -1] .= missing;
	genosOnly_with_missing = Matrix{Union{Missing, Float32}}(genosOnly_with_missing) 
end
```

Load `Impute` package:

```julia
using Impute
```

Now actually impute the missing genotype values:

```julia
@time imputed_genos = Impute.svd(genosOnly_with_missing)
```

### _Let's make the PCA plot!_

```julia
begin
	PCAmodel = GenomicDiversity.plotPCA(imputed_genos, ind_with_metadata,
			groups_to_plot, group_colors;
			sampleSet="Zonotrichia sparrows", regionText="whole_genome",
			flip1=false, flip2=false, showPlot=true)
	PCAmodel.PCAfig  # shows the figure
end
```
![](SparrowDemo_PCA.jpg){width=75% fig-align=center}

Gold symbols represent Golden-crowned Sparrows.
Blue represent the _gambelii_ form of White-crowned Sparrows.
Red represent that the _pugetensis_ form of White-crowned Sparrows.

### Now let's produce a genotype-by-individual plot

Our overall dataset has close to 46,000 SNPs, far too many to visualize meaningfully in a single plot. We can come up with a meaningful subset by examining variation on a single scaffold (i.e., chromosome in this case) and only showing the SNPs that strongly differ in allele frequency between chosen groups.

We'll calculate allele frequencies and sample sizes for each group, and then genetic differentiation (known as FST) between the groups:

```julia
freqs, sampleSizes = GenomicDiversity.getFreqsAndSampleSizes(genosOnly_with_missing,
                            ind_with_metadata.Fst_group, groups_to_plot)
```

```julia
Fst, FstNumerator, FstDenominator, pairwiseNamesFst = GenomicDiversity.getFst(freqs,
                                            sampleSizes, groups_to_plot)
```

Now we will choose a scaffold and specify some other parameters for the plotting algorithm:

```julia
begin
	chr = "CM018231.2" # the name of a scaffold in the reference genome
	regionInfo = GenomicDiversity.chooseChrRegion(pos_whole_genome, chr) # this gets the maximum position for the chromosome
	group1 = "GCSP"   # the alleles most common in this  group will be assigned the same color in the graph
	groupsToCompare = "GCSP_PSWS" # The groups to compare for the Fst filter below
	Fst_cutoff =  0.8
	missingFractionAllowed = 0.2
end
```

Finally, we can actually make the plot:

```julia
plotInfo = GenomicDiversity.plotGenotypeByIndividualWithFst(groupsToCompare, 
    Fst_cutoff, missingFractionAllowed, regionInfo, 
    pos_whole_genome, Fst, pairwiseNamesFst, 
    genosOnly_with_missing, ind_with_metadata, freqs, 
    groups_to_plot, group_colors)
plotInfo[1] # this outputs the plot
```
![](SparrowDemo_GBI.jpg){width=75% fig-align=center}

The figure shows the genotypes of individuals at SNPs that have Fst higher than `Fst_cutoff` in the groups being compared (given by `groupsToCompare`). The two alleles have different shades of purple, with triangles indicating heterozygotes. The bottom of the plot indicates the location of SNPs on the chromosome, and the blue shading indicates SNP density across the chromosome.

If the function works on your computer like it does on mine, it will create a separate plot window and show the figure both there and in your Pluto notebook.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Produce such plots for a series of chromosomes
Can you write a loop to cycle through a number of different chromosomes and make a plot for each? You would use a lot of the code in the previous two cells above. You could do this for these scaffolds, expressed here a a vector of strings: `["CM018230.2", "CM018231.2", "CM018232.2", "CM018233.2", "CM018234.2"]`

### A take-home message:

The `GenomicDiversity.plotGenotypeByIndividual()` function produces this complex plot from the repeated use of low-level plotting functions to simply draw lines, filled shapes, and text in the plotting window. *If you learn the commands to draw such simple elements and the logic by which to determine where to draw them, you can design your own functions to make all sorts of complex figures.*
