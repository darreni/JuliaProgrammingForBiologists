To install Julia, go to this URL and follow instructions: https://julialang.org/downloads/

That website will likely detect your operating system and suggest the right approach.

On a Mac, you simply open a Terminal window (look for the Terminal application in your `Applications/Utilities` directory) and type the command below at the Terminal prompt:

`curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`

The above command installs the Juliaup installation manager, which is a wonderful tool to help update Julia and keep different versions (if you wish) available on your computer.
