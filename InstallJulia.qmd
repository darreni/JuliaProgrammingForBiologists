To download and install Julia, go to this URL and follow instructions: <https://julialang.org/downloads/>

That website will likely detect your operating system and suggest the right approach.

On a Mac, the above will direct you to simply open a Terminal window (look for the Terminal application in your `Applications/Utilities` directory) and type the command below at the Terminal prompt:

`curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`

The above command installs the Juliaup installation manager, which is a wonderful tool to help update Julia and keep different versions (if you wish) available on your computer.

### Now, run Julia!

In the Terminal window, type `julia` at the prompt. After some time (only the first time you do this), you should see a julia logo and a prompt saying `julia>` . This means Julia is installed and running.

Try typing a simple calculation, e.g. `1 + 3`, and see what happens.

Now try typing `"Hello, nice to meet you"` (make sure you put the quotes).

Now, go to the next page to learn more about interacting with Julia.
